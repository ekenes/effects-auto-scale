# Automatically scaled layer effects

- [Open the app](https://ekenes.github.io/effects-auto-scale/)
- Apply a layer effect to a base layer or an operational layer (either `bloom` or `drop-shadow`)
- Make adjustments to params as necessary
- Zoom in and out to observe how well the effect looks across various scales
- Uncheck the `auto adjust by scale` checkbox to compare the difference between scale-driven and non scale-driven effects.

## Install the app

- Clone the repo.
- Run `npm run tsc -w` to make changes to the code.
